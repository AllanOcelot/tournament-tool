# About:
Esports is exploding, big budgets allow for the orginisation of large scale events - large cash prizes and tense live moments to be shared with millions.

Behind every large scale e-sports tournament however, there is tournament software to track teams, their ranking, kills etc etc.

My aim with this repo is to provide a robust tool that can be hosted on the sub domain of a website, providing all the information teams may need.
